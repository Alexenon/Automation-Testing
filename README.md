# Automation-Testing

This project was required to learn testing frameworks such as `TestNG, JUnit, Selenium and Serenity`

Here I use site with url https://demoqa.com, that actually is designed to find bugs for beginners

Also here I use some RESP API for `GET` and `POST` methods, and a bunch of more usefull things
